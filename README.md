# Autocomplete text with this AI Cowriter

Live version of this app at [ai-cowriter.com](https://ai-cowriter.com)

## Description

This mini-app acts as your cowriter for any kind of text. Just start to type and your AI companion - powered by OpenAI's [GPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) - will suggest words and phrases to complete your text.

The text prompt creation form only requires an indication of what type of text you are writing (blog post, LinkedIn post, Tweet, or Email). It optionally accepts a topic and mood parameter. The app then generates a prompt with an instruction to suggest the next words and sends this to the OpenAI API which predicts the next likely to be used tokens.

The UI displays the suggested completion and allows the user to accept or reject it to continue writing.

## Contribution

I hope this will be of value to people seeking to understand GPT-3's current capabilities and the overall progress of natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI. Plus maybe you can actually use the app to speed up your writing process, even though this is a very crude MVP.

Please reach out to me at nikolas@schriefer.me with any feedback - especially suggestions to improve this - or questions you might have.
